# PUCMG-frontend
## CONTEXT

This project is a part of the lato sensu post graduation degree in Full Stack Web Development, concluded in 2020 at Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas gerais (Put Minas).

The objective is to present the technical skills related to the completion of the course with a real case study. In this case, I present a tool to help food producers avoid waste in their business, offering greater control over the products available in stock and of course, all the waste that is being made due to expired items.
